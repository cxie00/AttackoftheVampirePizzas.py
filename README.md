I coded this for a camp I teach at a coding camp for children ages 7-14 using the 2019 book: "Code This Game!" by Meg Ryan.  
This is a python game using the pygame library and assets from "Code This Game!"  
It will introduce python and programming fundamentals like conditionals, variables, and classes to students.
